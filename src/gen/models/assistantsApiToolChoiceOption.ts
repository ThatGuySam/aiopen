 * Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
`required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.
