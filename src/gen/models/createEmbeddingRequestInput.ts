 * Input text to embed, encoded as a string or array of tokens. To embed multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array of strings or array of token arrays. The input must not exceed the max input tokens for the model (8192 tokens for `text-embedding-ada-002`), cannot be an empty string, and any array must be 2048 dimensions or less. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens. Some models may also impose a limit on total number of tokens summed across inputs.
