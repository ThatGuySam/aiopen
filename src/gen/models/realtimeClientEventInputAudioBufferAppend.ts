/**
 * Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio
buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. In Server VAD
mode, the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide
when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer
manually.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum
of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the
VAD to be more responsive. Unlike made other client events, the server will
not send a confirmation response to this event.
