/**
 * This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering
model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses
automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case
the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the
conversation history.

The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items
and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the
Response is complete.

The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like
`instructions`, and `temperature`. These fields will override the Session's
configuration for this Response only.
