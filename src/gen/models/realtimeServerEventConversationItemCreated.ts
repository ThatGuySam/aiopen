 * Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that
produce this event:
  - The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce
    either one or two Items, which will be of type `message`
    (role `assistant`) or type `function_call`.
  - The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the
    server (in `server_vad` mode). The server will take the content of the
    input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.
  - The client has sent a `conversation.item.create` event to add a new Item
    to the Conversation.
