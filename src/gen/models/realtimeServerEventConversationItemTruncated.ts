/**
 * Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the
client with a `conversation.item.truncate` event. This event is used to
synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript
to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.
